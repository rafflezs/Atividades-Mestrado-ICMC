	abstract = {Over the last decades, hospitals have faced increasing financial pressure due to rising costs and changes in reimbursement policies. One of the reasons for this development is the rising number of qualified personnel required to handle the consistently growing demand for hospital services. In the U.S., on average more than 50\% of hospital costs are workforce related. In order to reduce these expenses without sacrificing quality of care, a stream of research has focused on building more efficient personnel schedules for nurses and physicians. We provide the first review that focuses on quantitative methods for physician scheduling in hospitals. We describe the relevant characteristics of various investigated physician scheduling problems, such as the problem type, i.e. Staffing, Rostering or Re-planning problems, personnel qualification and experience, and the utilized shift types. Furthermore, we analyze the existing literature with respect to additional modeling features including fairness aspects and underlying demand patterns, as well as employed solution approaches and real life applications. In total, we review 68 relevant publications in the OR/MS field. We use our presented framework to categorize the existing approaches and highlight gaps in the literature to initiate future research activities.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a hybridization of a Constraint Programming (CP) model and search techniques with Local Search (LS) and some ideas borrowed from Genetic Algorithms (GA). The context is the physician rostering problem, whose instances can vary greatly and for which almost no general tool has been developed. It is hoped that the combination of the three techniques will lead to an algorithm that has sufficient flexibility to solve most instances with a small amount of customization. To achieve this goal we also introduce Generic constraints: these constraints are used to model several types of ergonomic constraints that are found amongst physician rostering problems.},

	abstract = {Personnel rostering has received ample attention in recent years. Due to its social and economic relevance and due to its intrinsic complexity, it has become a major subject for scheduling and timetabling researchers. Among the personnel rostering problems, nurse rostering turned out to be particularly complex and difﬁcult. In this paper, we propose a notation for nurse rostering problems along the lines of the α{\textbar}β{\textbar}γ notation for scheduling. The system allows extension as well as reﬁnement. It is the aim of the notation to facilitate problem description, classiﬁcation and systematic study. It enables authors to position the problems in the vaster body of research on the subject. By developing this notation for nurse rostering, we hope that an extension of it will be applicable to a broader domain of personnel rostering.},
