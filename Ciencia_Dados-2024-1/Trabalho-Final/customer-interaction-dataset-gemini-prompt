It have the following readme text:

As you can see, all the features that use lists have 5 items each. Apparently this dataset assumes all client made 5 buys only. And the indexes are realated, so index 0 from Purchase_Date is the date that the product with index 0 from Products' list was bought. Also, this dataset have no NaN or Null values.

I'm trying to test the following hypothesys.

1 - Is there any relation between the customer age and it's purchase volume?
2 - Is there any relation between the customer age and it's interaction and relations to the marketing campaings?
3 - Is there any relation between the conversion rate and the customer website interactions?
4 - Does the customer socioeconomic range affects it's interactions with the ecommerce?
5 - Are marketing campaing reactions a good indicative of the customer interaction? Is it possible to predict their marketing campaing response based on their interactions?
