# ADALINE

Envisioned by Bernard Widrow and Ted Hoff in their 60's work [An Adaptive "Adaline" Neuron Using Chemical "Memistor"](https://isl.stanford.edu/~widrow/papers/t1960anadaptive.pdf)
Adaline consists of a single layer neuron network.

# RUN

To run the project, clone it, navigate to the directory [RedesNeurais-ICMC24/Atividade1-ADALINE/src](https://github.com/rafflezs/RedesNeurais-ICMC24/tree/main/Atividade1-ADALINE/src), and execute the command ```python main.py```.

If you want to change the training data, simply modify the variable ```label_train``` to match the desired folder name. The value ```"+1"``` corresponds to the data for the symbol "Y" and ```"-1"``` to the data for the "Inverted Y".
